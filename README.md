# API-Project-2020
Algorithms and Principles of Informatics (API) Project - Year 2020

The aim of the project was to code a text editor reading input lines and memorizing and visualizing them with commands: change, delete, print. Then undo and redo were implemented to act on previous commands. Time and memory constraints have been imposed to make sure the right algorithms and data structures were employed.
